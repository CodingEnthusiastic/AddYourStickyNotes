**Daily-Writing-Goal-Tracker**
This application is built under the guidance of Honorable . Professor Rohit Negi , which uses HTML , CSS AND JS along with some help from bootstrap framework(just for building the calendar) . I have added the knowledge of all my previous project in it , do check it out.

**Introduction**
Coding Enthusiastic presents you a blend of knowledge and wisdom , it is a website which allows you to add your notes in two different ways , either as your own sticky notes or the notes marked in the calendar(we indians usually mark exam dates on house-calendars) . To add salt to it , I have also added a quiz part which challenges you to play our own KBC .. Come and Lets play this out , have your recommendations on this repository.

**Intuition**
The website has taken inspiration from Google calenders and Notes application , and thought why cant we merge down these two and create a great website , with improved User Interface. Along with this , DSA Quizzes and some general quiz are added so that user can spend their time in gaining knowledge and have some fun.

**Features**
1)Core features
a)Mark up your dates on our 2-phased interface , either as a card or on our calender itself .
b)Time hi nahi hai :-no need to say more , use our ownly developed Calenders and be on time

2)Bonus feature
a)Dreamt of playing KBC,do not worry,this application brings it true
b)Dynamic grid structure used to store the notes

**How to use**
1) Go to website https://codingenthusiastic.github.io/Daily-Writing-Goal-Tracker/
2) Add your notes as much as you want
3) If tired or bored , use our own Calendar feature which allows you to have Calendar as well as Notes
4) After completing your work , go to **Make Up Some Mood** tab and enjoy some spicy DSA and development quizzes
5) Just to list out , I could not add localstorage part , so the data once written do not get saved and once refreshed it automatically disappears. This will be developed as I master out backend entirely after some days.

**Technical Skills :**
1) HTML pages : main page where interactive navbar is present and we can add cards on the website , then indexcalendar.html page which renders other html file which consist a calendar and then kbc.html which consist your own quiz application.
2) CSS :- most of the styling are provided in styles.css , however to avoid duplication , some css code is written in html files itself that are very small in size , like abort.html
3) JS :- edit , delete and addition of notes is possible only due to Javascript file script.js . Also I have used random() function and some Mathematics to generate questions uniquely for every user and make the website innovative.
4)Little help of bootstrap framework to add calendar class in my code

**Future Enhancement**
1)I would definitely look into learning localstorage part and save all the changes made by user on the website . These changges need to be permanent if same user works on the website.
2)Implementing backend and database after acquiring knowledge would definitely boost this project since data storage would become relatively easier and majority of the bugs in this application would get sorted out 


Thanks a lot , Rohit sir for this competition. I would like yto hear your views soon . Thank you
